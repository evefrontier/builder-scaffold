# Builder flow

End-to-end flow to test builder-scaffold against world-contracts as a builder.

- **Testnet:** [builder-flow-testnet.md](./builder-flow-testnet.md) — run on host or in Docker after switching network.
- **Local:** [builder-flow-local.md](./builder-flow-local.md) — run inside the [Docker](../docker/readme.md) container (same steps; paths and keys are for the container).
